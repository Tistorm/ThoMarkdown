# ThoMarkdown
## A Simple Markdown Editor for OS X

---

ThoMarkdown is just a playground project to see how markdown works, to play with 
[NSTask](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSTask_Class/Reference/Reference.html)
and 
[NSPipe](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSPipe_Class/Reference/Reference.html), and to check out 
[WebView](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/WebKit/Classes/WebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html).

To run the app, you need multimarkdown and copy it into the project folder.
You can, of course, use any other markdown implementation but will have to adjust the code accordingly.

* Please, note that this is the work of less than two hours on a lazy sunday afternoon - don't expect anything that works or actually does something useful for you.
* Also note that part of the CSS in the bundle is shamelessly borrowed from TextMate.
